#### Canny Edge Detector: It is an edge detection operator which uses a multistage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. 
#### Process : 
- Gaussian Filter 
- Finding intensity gradient of image 
- Gradient magnitude thresholding or lower bound cut off suppression 
- Double threshold 
- Edge tracking. 
#### Line detection in gray-scale images is a low-level processing which has many applications such as road detection in remote images and vessel detection in medical images. 
#### A primitive connection based algorithm for detecting line segments is proposed. **Canny Operator** is used to detect edges in a digital image and all the edges are tracked to form series of edge point chains by a **4-neighbour priority eight direction tracking method**. 
#### In the end, line segments are produced by merging several primitives tested on both synthetic and real images.
